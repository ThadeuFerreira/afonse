# Music Teacher AI – Agent Guide

This document describes the project for AI agents (e.g. OpenClaw) interacting with this codebase or the running system.

---

## What This System Does

Music Teacher AI is a **local knowledge base of song lyrics and metadata** designed to help English teachers find songs suitable for language learning.

It ingests data from Spotify, Billboard, and Genius into a local SQLite database, then exposes that data through a CLI, REST API, and MCP interface.
The API also includes education endpoints that transform lyrics into classroom-ready artifacts.

---

## Available Interfaces

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The preferred interface for AI agents.

Start the MCP server:

```
python -m music_teacher_ai.api.mcp_server
```

The server communicates via stdin/stdout using newline-delimited JSON.

**Tool discovery:** On startup, the server emits a JSON object:

```json
{"tools": [...]}
```

**Calling a tool:**

Send a JSON line:

```json
{"tool": "search_songs", "inputs": {"word": "dream", "year_min": 1990, "year_max": 1999}}
```

Response:

```json
{"result": [...]}
```

### Available MCP Tools

#### search_songs

Search by keyword, year, artist, or genre.
Returns an object:

- `results` – array of songs
- `database_expansion_triggered` – boolean indicating whether background expansion was triggered

Input fields (all optional):

- `word` – keyword to find in lyrics
- `year` – exact release year
- `year_min` / `year_max` – year range
- `artist` – artist name filter
- `genre` – genre filter
- `limit` – max results (default 20)

#### semantic_search

Search by theme or concept using vector similarity.

Input fields:

- `query` (required) – e.g. `"songs about losing hope"`
- `top_k` – number of results (default 10)

#### get_lyrics

Retrieve full lyrics for a song.

Input fields:

- `song_id` (required) – integer ID from search results

#### find_similar_lyrics

Find songs whose lyrics are semantically similar to a given song, song title, or text fragment.

Input fields (provide one of):

- `song_id` – integer ID of the reference song
- `song_title` – title string (partial match); combine with `artist` to disambiguate
- `text` – lyric fragment or theme description, e.g. `"dreaming about a better world"`

Optional:

- `top_k` – number of results (default 10)
- `min_score` – minimum similarity threshold 0.0–1.0 (default 0.0)

#### create_playlist

Create a playlist from a search query and save it locally. Returns the full playlist object.

Input fields:

- `name` (required) – playlist name
- `description` – optional
- `word` / `year` / `year_min` / `year_max` / `artist` / `genre` – keyword filters
- `semantic_query` – theme query, e.g. `"songs about hope"`
- `similar_text` – text to find similar songs for
- `similar_song_id` – song ID to find similar songs for
- `limit` – max songs (default 20)

#### list_playlists

List all saved playlists. Returns array of playlist objects.

Input: none.

#### get_playlist

Get a saved playlist by slug.

Input fields:

- `playlist_id` (required) – slug from `list_playlists`

#### export_playlist

Export a playlist as text in M3U, M3U8, or JSON.

Input fields:

- `playlist_id` (required)
- `format` – `json`, `m3u`, or `m3u8` (default `m3u`)

#### find_vocabulary_examples

Find songs containing specific words.

Input fields:

- `words` (required) – list of strings
- `year`, `year_min`, `year_max`, `limit` – optional filters
